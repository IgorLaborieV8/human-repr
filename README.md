## What it does

Easily generate human-readable descriptions directly on primitive numbers, of several kinds:
- counts: which get SI prefixes: "k", "M", "G", "T", "P", "E", "Z", "Y";
- durations: with support for nanoseconds, millis, ¬µs, secs, and even HH:MM:SS;
- throughputs: which get, in addition to SI prefixes, support for /day, /hour, /month, and /sec!!

They work on the following Rust primitive types: `u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize, f32, f64, i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, isize`.
<br>The entity they refer to is configurable, so you can send "B" for bytes, or "it" for iterations, or "errors", etc.
<br>Bytes have dedicated methods for convenience.

It is also blazingly fast, taking only ~80 ns to generate, and well-tested. Does not use any dependencies.

You can, for example:

```rust
use human_repr::HumanRepr;

// counts (bytes or anything)
assert_eq!("43.2 MB", 43214321_u32.human_count_bytes());
assert_eq!("123.5 kPackets", 123456_u64.human_count("Packets"));

// durations
assert_eq!("15.6 ¬µs", 0.0000156.human_duration());
assert_eq!("10 ms", 0.01.human_duration());
assert_eq!("1:14:48", 4488.395.human_duration());

// throughputs (bytes or anything)
assert_eq!("1.2 MB/s", (1234567. / 1.).human_throughput_bytes());
assert_eq!("6.1 tests/m", (10. / 99.).human_throughput("tests"));
assert_eq!("9 errors/d", (125. / 1200000.).human_throughput("errors"));

```

## How to use it

Add this dependency to your Cargo.toml file:

```toml
human-repr = "0"
```

Use the trait:

```rust
use human_repr::HumanRepr;
```

That's it! You can now call on any number:

```rust
num.human_count("unit");
num.human_count_bytes();

num.human_duration();

num.human_throughput("unit");
num.human_throughput_bytes();
```

## Rust features:

- `1024` => enable to apply prefixes by `1024` instead of `1000`
- `iec` => enable to use IEC prefixes: `"Ki", "Mi", "Gi", "Ti", "Pi", "Ei", "Zi", "Yi"` (implies `1024`)
- `nospace` => enable to remove the spaces: `15.6¬µs` instead of `15.6 ¬µs`

## Changelog highlights
- 0.1.x Jun 01, 2022: first release, include readme, method and module docs, describe features already implemented
